## About
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build and execute server-side applications using JavaScript. It was developed by Ryan Dahl and initially released in 2009.


Some of the key features in NodeJs include
- __JavaScript Runtime__: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google. This engine compiles JavaScript code into native machine code, making it highly efficient and fast.

- __Event-Driven Architecture__: Node.js operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This means that it can handle multiple connections simultaneously without waiting for one operation to complete before moving on to the next. This architecture is particularly well-suited for applications that require high concurrency, such as real-time applications and APIs.

- __Single-Threaded Event Loop:__ Node.js operates using a single-threaded event loop, which manages asynchronous operations efficiently. While Node.js itself is single-threaded, it can handle concurrent requests by offloading I/O operations to a separate thread pool.
