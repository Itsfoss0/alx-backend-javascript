## About
JavaScript promises are a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allow you to work with asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable way. They provide a standardized syntax for handling asynchronous operations and make it easier to write asynchronous code that is more readable and less prone to callback hell.

At their core, promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to attach callbacks to handle the results. Instead of relying on callback functions, promises use a chainable syntax that makes it easier to handle asynchronous operations in a sequential and predictable manner.
