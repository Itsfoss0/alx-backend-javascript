## About
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that they perform as expected. The primary goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of code (typically a function or method) behaves correctly and produces the expected results when given specific inputs. Unit tests help catch and prevent defects early in the development process, leading to more reliable and maintainable software
