## About
The release of ES6 introduced numerous exciting features, including new data structures like maps and sets, spread operators and rest parameters, promises for asynchronous programming, and an expanded set of array methods, among others. In this project, our focus will be on exploring the frequently utilized ES6 features and discussing some of the recommended practices for writing JavaScript. Hang tight as we get back to __#DoHardThings__
